num1=10
num2=20
num3 = num1+num2 #always the right values are calculated and assigns it to the left value
print(num3) #You can always use double paranthesis as python accepts both single and double

#now assignment becomes tedious when we deal with the operations for the assigned value
#num3 = num3 + num2 # which we know that the calculated value then does the operation of adding num3 with num2 and here comes the shorthand method of dealing the same in python
#print(num3)
#shorthand method
num3+=num2
print(num3)
